    <h1>Branching</h1>
    <h2>A website to Practice Branching with Git</h2>
    <p>This page is basically to let me practice branching with Github and Git. Branching let's us have different versions of the work in one repository. Each coder can work on a different version of the code without colliding with the rest. Also, it allows us to experiment with differemt changes and we can choose a final product without affecting it. You get to try different solutions.</p>
